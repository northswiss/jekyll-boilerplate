Today is an exciting day for TravelPerk and its community. We are happy to announce that [we’ve raised a $7 million Series A](http://techcrunch.com/2016/06/09/travelperk-gets-7m-series-a-to-take-the-pain-out-of-booking-business-travel/), led by Spark Capital and with the participation of Sunstone, LocalGlobe, and existing investors.
 
We started TravelPerk in January 2015 with the ambitious goal to fix business travel, and to make it enjoyable and frustration-free for the bookers and travelers alike.
 
Business travel, a $1.2 trillion market, is completely underserved by technology and innovation, and is about to go through a revolution in the next five years. Travelers expect a consumer-grade experience when interacting with products, but today’s existing solutions often feel unnecessarily restrictive, expensive and non-intuitive.
 
TravelPerk is well positioned to become a leader in this space thanks to its consumer-grade product, outstanding customer support, and laser-focus on the issues of today’s business booker and traveler. We also have the best team in the industry with a proven track record of success.
 
[Our first product](http://travelperk.com/), released several months ago, allows business travel arrangers, such as Office Managers and Personal Assistants, to search, book and manage their team’s travel from our easy-to-use, free product and with support from our team whenever they need it.
 
The new funding round will be used to hire more top-notch team members to join our fantastic team based in Barcelona; we are looking for the best developers, product owners and designers in the world – so please check our [careers page](http://travelperk.bamboohr.co.uk/jobs/) if you are one of them.
