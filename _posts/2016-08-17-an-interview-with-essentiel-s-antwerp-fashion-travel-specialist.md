**Can you please introduce yourself, your role, and your company?**

My name is Magali Fornoville. I am an office manager at the headquarters of the fashion brand Essentiel in Antwerp, Belgium.

**What attracted you to your role?**

When I started out at Essentiel seven years ago, booking flights and hotels was only a small part of my job. Many of my colleagues booked their own trips, making it very hard to get an overall view of travel costs. 

Gradually, we started opening more shops abroad and as a result, the company felt the need for a more centralized travel management. With that, all bookings had to go through me as I worked with our travel agency. 

As we booked more and more trips, we noticed how much of our travel budget was spent on travel agency fees. As a result, upper management recently asked me if I would be interested in working as “our own travel agency” by booking all flights and hotels myself and no longer through a travel agency.

For me, these new responsibilities are a huge challenge as I’ve had no education whatsoever in tourism or travel management. I had to teach (and am still teaching) myself how to go about it all, like finding well-positioned hotels within our budget or finding flights that meet my both my colleague and management’s expectations. I have always been an avid “Googler”, so searching for information and doing research is something I enjoy doing. Therefore, looking for the best travel arrangements is something I don’t mind spending time on. I have also always loved talking to people, especially in different languages, so the interaction with people working with airlines and hotels from around the world is something I really enjoy.


**How is your typical day structured? How do you receive travel requests?**

When I enter the office in the morning, the first thing I do is check my e-mails because that is where I receive all travel requests. When I was told we would no longer work with a travel agency, I created a Travel File which all travellers have to fill in and send to me for each trip. On the Travel File, they are required to write down the travel date, destination, preferred hours, and the reason for their trip, all of which is very important information for our accounting department.

**How do you prepare employees for a trip?**

I send my colleagues all the necessary trip confirmations. If needed, I arrange everything for a travel visa. Finally, I check them in online before their flights. For better management, I always make a file that contains all the paperwork because they still prefer having a hardcopy of all the information.

**Can you tell us about a particularly difficult problem you overcame when it came to business travel at your company?**

When I started out as a receptionist there was no general policy for business travel, so many of my colleagues booked their own trips, there was little control over the travel budget, and there was lack of awareness when it came to changing and cancelling travel arrangements.

Over the last few years, we were able to set some standards by establishing a maximum budget for hotel rooms and anticipating spend for travel expenses such as taxis and food. I’ve also been trying to make people more aware of the consequences of cancelling travel arrangements by repeating the cancellation policies of hotels and airlines associated with a trip to my colleagues.

Centralizing all travel bookings has made all of this much easier, especially when considering each individual traveller’s own travel preferences and finding a balance between what is best for them at a reasonable price for the company. It also a great way for Essentiel to maintain some control over the budget as it's easier keep an eye on prices overall.

**What kind of travel policy does your company implement when sending employees away on business?**

First of all, we ask employees to always travel economy class on flights and 2nd class in trains. Sometimes, we make exceptions for long-distance flights if the price difference isn’t too great.

Secondly, we have a maximum budget for hotel rooms. Of course, we sometimes have to go over that budget to find a hotel that isn’t not too far from where our travelers have to be while still feeling comfortable enough for the duration of their trip. What helps are the corporate rate contracts we hold with several hotels in the cities where we have our own shops, like Paris, Madrid, Palma de Mallorca, Marbella and Amsterdam.

Finally, employees also get a fixed amount of expense spend during their trip. This covers anything from lunch and dinner to taxi rides from the airport to their destination. Employees are always urged to take public transport in cities like Paris, London, and Milan as taxi rides are far more expensive.

**What kind of challenges does your company encounter when trying to handle the itineraries of so many people/groups of people?**

Keeping a clear overview of each trip can be a challenge. If I have to book several trips in a short period, I have to keep my wits about me as to not forget cancelling a hotel reservation, changing a train ticket, etc. 

To help, I have developed an e-mail system that ensures all information about each individual trip stays grouped together. For every trip, a sub-file is created, sorted per date, that helps keep a high-level view of every trip going at that time. TravelPerk will continue being a huge help for this, I’m sure!

**How do you control travel costs and keep an eye on what people spend? Which cost is the most difficult one to control?**

We try to keep costs down as much as possible by closing corporate contracts with airlines, hotels and train operators, providing a fixed amount for extra expenses, fixing a maximum budget for hotel rooms and of course the company relies on me to sound the alarm if one of the employees keeps asking for flights and hotels that don’t fit into the budget. 

The most difficult cost to control is the last minute changing and cancelling of tickets, hotel bookings etc. We try to sensitize our employers for this, but unforeseen circumstances are a current phenomenon in our company ;) 

**What are the top three tools and apps that are necessary for you?**

As I’ve only recently started managing business travel for Essentiel, I am still searching for useful apps. Until I discovered TravelPerk, I used sites like Google Flights and Skyscanner for flights and Booking.com for hotels. Now, they’re not necessary.

**What have been the top three benefits from using [TravelPerk](https://wwww.travelperk.com) in your position?** 

I’ve only been using TravelPerk for a little over a month now, and one thing I’ve found most useful is how it saves me from entering credit card details each time it’s necessary along with taking into account card limits. 

Another feature I also found useful is being to enter traveller details in Travel perk so it isn’t required to enter birth dates and passport details every time a new booking is made. 

What I also like a lot about TravelPerk getting all the relevant details regarding online check-in as a well as a direct link to it under each flight.

A fourth benefit is the ability to name every trip. For our accounting department, it’s very important to understand the reason for each trip. This makes it easier to categorise it correctly for financial purposes. This name also appears on the invoice, helping us avoid wasting additional time trying to figure out why the traveller went on their trip. 

**What general tips would you give to the person in the role of managing travel?**

As I’m a newbie in the job just starting to explore the many possibilities available in the world of business travel, I think I’m the one needing tips from other travel managers.  At the moment, though, I am searching for good newsletters that can keep me up-to-date on the latest travel news or new apps and service that can help me with my travel bookings.
