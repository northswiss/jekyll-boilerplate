## This is a header 2
When you create a new line, it creates a paragraph, so just start writing.

### This is a header 3
Headers use the hash sign (#) to depict what sort of header it should be. H1 = #, H2 = ## and so on. The more hashes you have means the smaller the header will become and the less relevant it will be for SEO. 

### This is a header 4
It is unlikely that for a blog post that you will need to go any further than a header 4.

## Adding images to the blog
Click on the image icon above and then in the path, put imgs/blog before your image. So, for example, if you upload an image called airplane.jpg, you will need to add imgs/blog before the path of the image, like this: imgs/blog/airplane.jpg

It is also good practice to give your image alt text, so fill this out in the box as well. This should try and focus on the keywords for the page where applicable. 

![Your image alt text]({{site.baseurl}}/imgs/blog/example-image.png)
