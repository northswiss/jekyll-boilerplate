## This is a header 2
The blog is formatted using Markdown. It's easier if you just head over to [this cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) and see some of the formatting options, use the toolbar above, or click the **?** button for formatting help.

Bold text is **wrapped in two asterixes** or with __two lower dashes__ ( ** or __ )

Italicised text is *wrapped in one asterix* or with _one lower dash_ ( * or _ )

### This is a header 3
Headers use the hash sign (#) to depict what sort of header it should be. H1 = #, H2 = ## and so on. The more hashes you have means the smaller the header will become and the less relevant it will be for SEO. 

### This is a header 4
It is unlikely that for a blog post that you will need to go any further than a header 4.

## Images

> Always re-size your images to be **max width 800px**. You can do this using tools like [Aviary](http://www.aviary.com) 

To add an image using MarkDown format, do this:
![Alt text for this external image](http://placehold.it/800x400)

Align an image like this:

`<img class="left" src="http://placehold.it/400x400"/>`

<img class="left" src="http://placehold.it/400x400"/>

### Image floated left
 
In this example, swap http:placehold.it/400x400 with your image path. For example, this could be http://google.com/my-image-name.jpg or if it is an image which you have uploaded, the path would be XXX

<img class="right" src="http://placehold.it/400x400"/>

### Image floated right
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

## Adding images to the blog
Click on the image icon above and then in the path, put imgs/blog before your image. So, for example, if you upload an image called airplane.jpg, you will need to add imgs/blog before the path of the image, like this: imgs/blog/airplane.jpg

It is also good practice to give your image alt text, so fill this out in the box as well. This should try and focus on the keywords for the page where applicable.
