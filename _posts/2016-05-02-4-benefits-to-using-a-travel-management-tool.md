Managing a team of dedicated employees and their travel arrangements is a taxing gig that requires all the help you can get. While corporate travel agencies are the usual go-to when it comes to booking airlines, hotels, and transportation, they introduce many points of friction. In this increasingly connected day and age, _these points of friction just don’t need to be there_. 

Consider the role of the internet: over the past 20 years, it has disrupted every industry from leisure travel to lodging to taxi services. Corporate travel management is no exception, with companies like ours working to provide travel managers like you with a more streamlined and intuitive platform to overhaul the entire process of traditional business travel booking. 

Systemizing your company’s corporate travel management offers a wealth of benefits to any travel manager looking to make their job easier while at the same time adding value. Below are fives benefits gained from a digitized travel solution: 

## 1. Streamlined processes

Emails, emails, and more emails: it’s usually the case that multiple rounds of communication are necessary to initiate, clarify, and finalize a travel request. While the results may be the same, time and control are lost in the process. This equates to a lack of efficiency and a loss of potential savings since information about transportation options are limited. 

Simplifying booking processes returns that control to those who demand it: you. Using them allows you to check and compare more flights and accommodations faster, usually guaranteeing a much better price without the hassle of multiple emails. Employees can book their own trips as well, not only increasing autonomy but also overall satisfaction. 

## 2. Reduced travel expenses

Making sure your teams stays under budget while ensuring an efficient, comfortable trip for them is a thin line to walk. Under and overspending means money left on the table, money that can be used and/or saved more efficiently. Static budgets don’t do very much to help travel managers in this regard as making sure they stay accurate is difficult due to constantly fluctuating prices. 

Unlike traditional corporate travel agencies, most digital corporate travel solutions are constantly connected. Some employ dynamic budgets as opposed to static budgets, too, meaning they take into account real-time pricing information along with your company’s travel policies. Together, you rest assured that budgets are always being met, no matter what. 

## 3. A more cost-conscious culture 

According to Expedia, a majority of small business travellers (91%) spend more on meals, hotel rooms and room service than when they travel on personal money. This happens because employer and employee interests aren’t aligned and is made worse from a fundamental lack of awareness of how these costs impact the bottom line. 

For both travel managers and the employees they manage, some digital travel solutions offer more visibility about budgeting requirements and the company policies that form their basis. This helps keep the focus of any communication between you and those you manage on how to make their business travel more efficient and comfortable. 

## 4. Generates valuable corporate travel data 

Putting everything into the hands of a corporate travel agent only serves to take it out of yours, depriving you of valuable data that can serve to improve your processes over time. Without it, you’re left groping in the dark, hoping the corporate travel company you’re dealing with truly has your bottom line in mind. (Plot twist: they probably don’t.)

Using digital travel solutions means generating troves of data full of valuable metrics like flight costs, hidden fees, travel frequency, hotel stay frequency, and many more. All of this valuable data can be used to better allocate funds and negotiate better deals with those most used flights and hotels — making you and those above you so much happier over the long-term.
