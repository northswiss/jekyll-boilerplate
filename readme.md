# TravelPerk Marketing website

## Getting started

First, use the terminal to locate the directory where you want to clone this repository.

Once inside the correct directory, run ```git clone git@github.com:travelperk/marketing_website.git```

This will copy the latest version of the site from Git to your local machine. 

## Dependencies
From the terminal run ```sudo npm install```. This should install all of the required dependencies. _Note that Jekyll itself has a dependancy on Ruby. If running a Mac, you should have Ruby already set up. Windows users...well...

Providing all of the dependecies installed correctly, run ```sudo gem install jekyll```

If everything has gone to plan, if you run ```gulp``` in the terminal the site should now be accessible at http://localhost:3000 _(note you may have to cancel and run gulp a second time for the initial build. This is a known bug)._

### Pages
Put all pages into the "pages" directory. Keeps the root nice and clean :)
