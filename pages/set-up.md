This boilerplate was made to stand on the shoulders of two giants. The first being the standard [Jekyll framework](http://jekyllrb.com/), and the second being the [HTML5 Boilerplate template](https://html5boilerplate.com).

On top of this, I have also baked in some standard goodies that I use to help streamline time to production. Please feel free to fork this project and suggest future improvements. 

Many thanks,
