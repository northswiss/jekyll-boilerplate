      <h2>TravelPerk is completely free</h2>
      <h3>How does TravelPerk make money?</h3>
      <p>When you book your travel using TravelPerk, we earn an affiliate commission and are paid a small percentage of the cost of travel from the airline or hotel meaning there is no additional cost or fees to you.</p>

      <h3>Is there a minimum term I need to sign up to?</h3>
      <p>No. With TravelPerk you are free to join or leave whenever you like without any ties, though we love our product, and we think you will too.</p>
