        <h3>Fixed budgets</h3>
        <p>Travel costs are not fixed, so why should your travel booking be? Having a fixed travel budget could mean that you pay much more during off-peak times or when travelling to cheaper destinations. <strong>Our DynamicBudget&trade; helps you to save</strong>.</p>
