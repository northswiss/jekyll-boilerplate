    <blockquote>
        "A majority of small business travelers (91%) spend more on meals, hotel rooms and room service than when they travel on personal money. In comparison to their older counterparts, millennials (aged 18 to 34) are likeliest to spend more on room service, transportation, alcohol, entertainment, first class airline seats and advance seat selections."
